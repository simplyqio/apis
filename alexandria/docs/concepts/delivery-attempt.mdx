The delivery attempt is a read-only audit record that is created when we attempt to delivery an event to an endpoint. The delivery attempt is created when the event is sent to the endpoint and is updated when the endpoint responds to the event. The delivery attempt is created with the status of "Pending" and is updated to "Success", "Failure", or "Cancelled" when the endpoint responds to the event.

## Configuration

There are no configurable attributes as the record is read-only and can only be updated by the system.
